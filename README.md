# ChestCrafter Basics

This is a simple plugin to spawn in chests anytime, anywhere.

You can find chest ids in the GM Handbook, look for SceneObj_Chest.

Fair Warning!! Many chests do not have proper handlers and won't open! Please feel free to experiment, but know that any chests that don't open are not an issue with the plugin!

## Background

This is a plugin I made a long time ago for proof-of-concept. There may be some issues with it, and it currently doesn't do actual custom chest content, only spawning in chests from the game anywhere you want.
Due to the nature of many chests not having drop data, or being locked (no way to open locked ones when spawning like this), this plugin just sat in my folders for a long time. Since there has been more interest lately and people asking for the plugin, I'm providing it now open source so maybe it can be improved or maybe help inspire better custom chest content.
